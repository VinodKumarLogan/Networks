Explanation
-----------

--------------------------------------------------------------
-> There is a 3-way handshake between the client and the server
   with corresponding values of seq and ack numbers

client:-

Sent 1 S
Received 24 2 SA
Connection Established
Sent Packet (Original) at 0.0003s Seq = 2 Ack = 25 Data = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

data is sent in the 3rd stage of the handshake

server:-

Establishing Connection.....
Received 1 S
Sent SYNACK: Seq = 24 Ack = 2 TCP Flag = SA
Connection Established

--------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------
->Data (packet) transmission to the server

client:-

Sent Packet (Original) at 0.0003s Seq = 2 Ack = 25 Data = AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Sent Packet (Original) at 0.0004s Seq = 85 Ack = 25 Data = BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB
Sent Packet (Original) at 0.0004s Seq = 140 Ack = 25 Data = CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC
Sent Packet (Original) at 0.0005s Seq = 180 Ack = 25 Data = DDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Ack received at 0.0005s  : Seq = 25 Ack = 85 TCP Flag = A
Ack received at 0.0006s  : Seq = 25 Ack = 140 TCP Flag = A
Ack received at 0.0006s  : Seq = 25 Ack = 239 TCP Flag = A
Congestion Window =  4

Congestion window size has not changed because only 3 acks were received at the client

the other packet transmission are similar to the one above

Sent Packet (Original) at 3.0058s Seq = 543 Ack = 25 Data = MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
Sent Packet (Original) at 3.0059s Seq = 627 Ack = 25 Data = NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN
Sent Packet (Original) at 3.0061s Seq = 681 Ack = 25 Data = OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Sent Packet (Original) at 3.0062s Seq = 775 Ack = 25 Data = PPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
Ack received at 3.0063s  : Seq = 25 Ack = 627 TCP Flag = A
Ack received at 3.0064s  : Seq = 25 Ack = 681 TCP Flag = A
Ack received at 3.0065s  : Seq = 25 Ack = 775 TCP Flag = A
Ack received at 3.0065s  : Seq = 25 Ack = 843 TCP Flag = A
Congestion Window =  5

The congestion window size has increased to 5 because the acks received at the client are equal to the packets sent to the server in this burst

->Connection Teardown

client:-

Sent 1145 26 F
Received 26 1146 F
Received 27 1146 F
Sent 1146 F
Connection Closed

Sends the FIN segment to the server , waits for the FIN's ack .
Again waits for the FIN packet from the server and sends an ack after it receives it and finaly closes the connection

server:-

Sent data:  26 1146 F
Sent data:  27 1146 F
Received data:  1146 F
Connection Closed

Waits for the FIN and sends an ACK to the client.
Sends a FIN segment and waits for the ACK before closing the connection
