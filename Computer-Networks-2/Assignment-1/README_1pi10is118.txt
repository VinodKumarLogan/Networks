My Contribution
-> Reasearch on IPV6 sockets TCP and UDP implementation
-> Designing the base algorithm to send and receive data using UDP and select mechanism 
-> Coding part involving creating IPV6 UDP packets and binding it.
-> Implementation of select() and analysing its return values ,sending and receiving data

Understanding of the Problem
-> 3-way chat involves the member sending and receiving simultaneously. 
-> A IPV6 socket needs to be created and bound to host address and port
-> We need to have the address and port numbers in the requires form(tuple) of both the destinations for the data to be sent using socket's sendto()
-> Similarly, data needs to be received at the running program using socket's recv(), so that it can be displayed on the chat along with its sender ID/Name
